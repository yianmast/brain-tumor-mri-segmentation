# 🧠 Brain Tumor Segmentation from MRI using Deep Learning

### 📍 Course Project – *AI for Medical Diagnosis* by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera

This is the final project of the *AI for Medical Diagnosis* course taught by Andrew Ng and DeepLearning.AI.  
The goal was to train a deep learning model that segments tumor regions from MRI brain scans using real 3D medical imaging data.

## 🧠 Project Summary

In this assignment, I developed a **multi-class image segmentation model** that detects:
- **Edema**
- **Non-enhancing tumor**
- **Enhancing tumor**

## 🛠️ Key Skills and Concepts

- ✅ MRI data handling with **NiBabel** and the **NIfTI** format
- ✅ Data exploration and voxel-based visualization
- ✅ Deep learning segmentation with **Keras**
- ✅ Custom loss functions and metrics for segmentation:
  - **Dice Score** for evaluation
- ✅ Model calibration and confidence-based prediction analysis
- ✅ Application of **Platt scaling** for output calibration
